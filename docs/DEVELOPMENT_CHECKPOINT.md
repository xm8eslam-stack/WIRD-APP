## Work preserved on the feature branch

The branch includes the cumulative Phase 4 work recorded in PR #1, including:

1. Backup v4 validation, canonical unified portion records, legacy migration, import write verification and storage rollback.
2. Local-calendar date correctness across profile/streak, sessions, retention, dashboard, revision, progress, advisor and settings.
3. Quran data validation and generated per-Surah chunks from the canonical complete Quran source; lazy loading in Quran Library, memorization sessions and Dashboard.
4. PWA/session audio cache with bounded retention and cache-upgrade handling.
5. Mobile ergonomics and 604-page progress map improvements.
6. On-demand Tafsir Muyassar integration with response validation, attribution and bounded local cache.
7. GitHub Actions quality gate for tests, TypeScript and production build.
8. Page progress accuracy: exact page-to-ayah segments, cross-Surah page support, no fabricated progress defaults, explicit full-page coverage, and conservative overlapping status handling.
9. Canonical backup/storage integrity: exact Surah ayah boundaries, canonical IDs, date/range validation, refusal to persist invalid records, and preserving invalid canonical data when no safe legacy recovery source exists.
10. Regression tests for the above, including partial-page completion and recovery edge cases.

For the authoritative complete change list, inspect PR #1 and compare the feature branch with `main`; this checkpoint is a handoff summary, not a substitute for reviewing the diff.

## Release / synchronization state

- PR #1 is merged and closed; `main` contains the full Phase 4 change set.
- Phase 5 changes are only on `feat/phase5-premium-ui-ux`; `main` remains at `15ec5069b4850968588be2e4363fbd182bf2a8fc` and does not yet contain the Phase 5 UI work.
- Google AI Studio connected to `main` will not see Phase 5 until it is safely merged.
- Vercel GitHub integration reported a **Ready Preview** for the PR feature branch before merge.
- Vercel Production deployment for merge commit `bc368d6894afacf420529ca55c827a21cd695635` was rejected with `api-deployments-free-per-day` (retry in 24 hours). Production deployment is **not confirmed**.
- Google AI Studio can now sync from `main`; the actual in-app sync must be confirmed by the user because this workspace cannot inspect the AI Studio UI.
- Vercel reported **Ready** for PR #2 at head `9df61b21ce2e5429452d555d20061ab597d5fdae`; Preview URL: https://wird-app-git-feat-phase5-premium-ui-ux-xm8eslam-9174s-projects.vercel.app. Re-check status for the latest documentation-only head. Production deployment after merge is not yet confirmed.
- Do not claim production deployment success or tell the user to sync Phase 5 into Google AI Studio before merge.

## Known cautions / next investigations

1. Confirm the user has synced the `main` branch in Google AI Studio and inspect any sync/build feedback they report.
2. Re-check Vercel Production deployment after the free daily deployment quota resets; do not bypass the limit.
3. Investigate the current build warning: `MemorizationTestsView` chunk is approximately 1.96 MB minified (about 345 KB gzip), above the 650 KB warning threshold. It likely includes a static dependency chain from `testQuestionGenerator` to `verifiedAyahs` / `completeQuranData.json`; inspect before changing and preserve test generation semantics.
4. Re-check Quran chunk-size warning and lazy-loading behavior in built output.
4. Inspect any remaining runtime/data flows that create `WirdPortion` IDs to ensure all use `createCanonicalPortionId`.
5. Confirm storage migration does not discard recoverable data and never silently replaces invalid canonical payload with empty data.
6. Re-check exact Quran source attribution and independent Tanzil comparison before claiming textual equivalence.
7. Do not change Firebase security rules, authentication, secrets, or Vercel project settings without explicit evidence and authorization.

## Exact continuation instruction

On resumption:

1. Read this checkpoint first and verify current `main` SHA before any edits.
2. PR #1 is already merged; do not attempt to merge it again.
3. Continue with Google AI Studio sync verification and Vercel Production deployment retry only after the quota reset.
4. Before any new feature work, inspect the current repository state and run CI.
5. If a tool/context limit approaches, commit safe work and update this checkpoint with exact SHAs, CI state, deployment state, and next action.
